# Hello, world! I'm Mehmet ARI.

This document is my manager README, but it’s written for you! 
I’ve packed it with information on how I do my best work, what I value, who I am, what I’m working on, and things you can ask me about. 
I’m hoping this makes our communication become more effective and helps us build a better working relationship.

All in all, I’m pretty adaptable in how I work and how I can best help you. 
I can dive into a high-level strategy, roll up my sleeves and write code, disscussing product development, optimize process, do system design, brainstorming at anything, or hop on a Zoom call and just figure it out. 
I feel like I am at my best, however, when I get to creatively solve problems and take action, & bring all of the team’s talents and ideas together to do just that!

## About me

* I was born in Istanbul/Uskudar and I live in Istanbul currently.
* I’ve been developing software for over 15 years also i started coding when I was 13.
* I love learning new things and applying them to my day-to-day life
* I’m always data-driven. If there is no data, I will search and find :)
* I have a [Logician](https://www.16personalities.com/intps-at-work) personality
* I’m the happiest if there is a clear structure and expectations
* I always chase(at i least try) best practices and high standard for everything, product development standards, meeting standards, process management, leadership styles, and so on
* I read a lot, mainly technical and leadership contents
* When I see a new problem, I’m always excited to jump in and learn and try to solve it
* I never hesitate to work at any level, I love coding, and I love leadership at any level
* I love seeing the long-term vision, and I could be unhappy if there is no plan for one year ahead
* I value:
    * Positive intent
    * Curious
    * Ownership
    * Decisions are taken by consensus
    * Frugality
    * Ambition
    * Passion
    * Creating Impact/Value
    * Ideation
    * Responsibility
    * Learner
    * Interrogator
    * Never gives up
* I love [Amazon’s leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)

## My working style

* I believe in the [servant leadership](https://wheniwork.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-servant-leadership-model/) model
* I prefer written decisions with [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)s/[ADR](https://adr.github.io)s
* There should be a structure/best practice for everything; it’s always ok to invent something new if there is a structure under it. Some things help me to be structured:
    * [Situational leadership](https://situational.com/situational-leadership/)
    * [Team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com)
    * [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
    * [Event storming meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming)
    * [Independent service heuristics](https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Independent-Service-Heuristics)
    * [OKRs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1d0rFtpi7FI9OevvlSRWDBb5dlNB53neH/edit)
    * [Executive actions teams](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1425DgeGvRsiaBhxvSuAIu5go-Ur7V6cU/edit)
* OKR framework is the key framework for me to follow the management by objectives approach
* I believe in [empowered teams](https://www.svpg.com/empowered-product-teams/).
    * I have always hated being a [code monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_monkey), and I don’t want anyone working with me to be one
    * **Come with problems to solve, not with solutions to code!**
* I look for small, incremental deliverables and a willingness to work on any task
* I change a lot by my new learnings; if you see me defending a new idea, that means I learned something new and digested that information and changed myself accordingly
* I want to earn your trust. I want to allow you the space to take calculated risks, be vulnerable with me, and also tell me when I could be doing something better. [Psychological safety](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/) is extremely important to me and I promise to never hold a failed project against you if it was based on sound assumptions.
* I believe in the [first-team/second team](https://youtu.be/BjE_mPoZPSg) model
    * I believe that leaders should be a team
* I do informal performance reviews to be ready for the formal one for all of us every 3 months so that we can clarify expectations as early as possible
* [Effective time management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OcsFuceN2WW1aa3sXBB9jAj3oVeW4Tx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117472000879558257694&rtpof=true&sd=true) is the key to all above
* I work mostly on weekends and the evenings for my own development as well as for duties that I cannot fulfill in the day due to my other/main responsibilities. I don't expect the same from you or I don't reward this behavior


### Your development

I believe that your career progression is your responsibility, but I’m always here to help:

* to ask you annoying questions about your progress
* to be a "study buddy" and grow/learn together
* to help you find projects that require you to learn in a certain area
* to broadcast your successes
* to challenge you


### Feedback

I always prefer [radically candid](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kim-Scott/dp/1250258405/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=1250258405&psc=1) feedback. 
Therefore I always try to deliver timely and continuous feedback, and I expect you to do the same thing to me.


### 1o1s

This is your meeting and your time: you set the agenda and determine what we talk about. My most effective 1:1s have an agenda that builds up through the week, but I've also had some great free-form ones. Don't feel bad if you don't come with something prepared.

If we don't have anything on the agenda, please expect me to try and get to know you better.

If you're struggling to find some topics, use the [Rose/Thorn/Bud](https://www.mindfulschools.org/inspiration/mindful-reflection/) framework and come up with them. I like hearing about problems/things that happened during your week because:

* I always learn something
* I get data points that help me make global process improvements
* I get a picture of what things you're great at
* I begin to understand which things you struggle with

**Don't save urgent matters for a 1-1**


### Trust

My default position is to trust everyone, be it work-related or not. I see people as they can share any information with me very openly, and I’m also always open to them. 

At work, I will trust that intentions are good by default. I will often provide feedback if I see something that I find is not beneficial to the company, whether that is my job or not. I will give direct feedback to individuals of all ranks if I observe this behavior.

If I feel my sincere feedback is not helpful to improve things despite my repeated attempts (I’m patient enough to provide the same feedback again), I tend to react by withdrawing the trust entirely, and sometimes I cannot build that trust environment again.

For this reason, I ask people working with me to always provide me direct feedback on time and respond to my feedback timely without holding back.

## Communicating with me

I believe in open communication, and I’m always responsive; you can reach me out in any way, and I do my best to respond as soon as possible.

I can follow your style; if you prefer written communication, I can move forward with the written format. If you prefer verbal communication, we can jump in a call and start talking. 

After all, I believe I’m here to help you.

Don’t hesitate to reach out from slack, WhatsApp, email, or call me directly anytime (depending on the urgency of the topic), or don’t hesitate to send a meeting request by checking my calendar (my calendar is always up-to-date)
